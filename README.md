# ðŸ§  MNIST Digit Classifier GUI ðŸŽ¨

This project is a simple hand-drawn digit classifier built using **PyTorch**, **Tkinter**, and **Pillow (PIL)**. It allows users to draw a digit (0â€“9) on a canvas and predicts the digit using a trained neural network on the MNIST dataset.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Digit drawing canvas with clear and predict buttons
- Neural network trained on MNIST dataset using PyTorch
- Real-time digit classification from drawings
- Simple and intuitive GUI using Tkinter

## ðŸ§° Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision pillow
